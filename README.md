# AgendaRaven

This project is an idea for a comprehensive scheduling app. 
It is currently deployed and in use at https://agendaraven.com, 
but it is still under very active development. 
Goals and features for future versions of the
app are divided into "tiers" which are listed below. The features of 
these tiers will be added in order, starting at tier one and
working down the hierarchy to more advanced levels of the
program.
