# AgendaRaven

This project is an idea for a comprehensive scheduling app. 
It is currently not complete. The necessary changes for the
app are divided into "tiers" which are listed below. These
tiers should be worked on in order, starting at tier one and
working down the hirearcy to more advanced levels of the
program. At least 90% of one tier needs to be complete to 
*start* the next tier, and **all** of a tier should be complete
before beginning the tier that is two or more levels below it.
